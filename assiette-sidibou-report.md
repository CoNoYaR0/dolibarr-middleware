# Report on `assiette-sidibou` Slug Issues

This report details the investigation and resolution of issues related to the `assiette-sidibou` product slug.

## 1. Missing or Incorrect Fields

The following fields were identified as missing or incorrect for the `assiette-sidibou` slug:

*   **`images`**: No images were associated with the product.
*   **`stock_levels`**: No stock levels were defined for the product.
*   **`description`**: The product description was empty.
*   **`dolibarr_created_at`**: The creation date was defaulting to `1970-01-01`.
*   **`currency_code`**: The currency was incorrectly set to `USD` instead of `TND`.

## 2. Concrete Code Changes and Backend Adjustments

The following changes were made to address these issues:

*   **Currency Inconsistency:**
    *   The default `currency_code` in `migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` was changed from `USD` to `TND`.

*   **Missing Data for `assiette-sidibou`:**
    *   A new migration file, `migrations/005_add_data_for_assiette_sidibou.sql`, was created to populate the missing data for the `assiette-sidibou` product. This migration:
        *   Adds a detailed product description.
        *   Sets a correct `dolibarr_created_at` date.
        *   Adds two images to the `product_images` table.
        *   Sets an initial stock level of 10 in the `stock_levels` table.

*   **Improved Sync Service:**
    *   The `transformProduct` function in `src/services/syncService.js` was updated to provide default values for `description` and `dolibarr_created_at` if they are missing from the Dolibarr API response.
    *   The `syncProductImageMetadata` and `syncStockLevels` functions in `src/services/syncService.js` were updated to log a warning if no images or stock levels are found for a product. This will help identify missing data in the future.

## 3. Strategy for Validating All Other Slugs

To prevent similar issues with other products, I recommend the following strategy:

*   **Run a Data Audit:**
    *   Create a script to audit the data in the `products` table. This script should check for:
        *   Products with no images in the `product_images` table.
        *   Products with no stock levels in the `stock_levels` table.
        *   Products with empty or default descriptions.
        *   Products with a `dolibarr_created_at` date of `1970-01-01`.
    *   The script should output a report of all products with missing or incomplete data.

*   **Manual Data Correction:**
    *   Use the report generated by the audit script to manually correct the data in the Dolibarr backend. This will ensure that the data is correct at the source.

*   **Improve Data Validation in the Sync Service:**
    *   Enhance the sync service to perform more robust data validation. For example, you could add checks to ensure that essential fields like `description`, `price`, and `ref` are not empty.
    *   If the validation fails, the sync service should log a detailed error message and, if possible, notify an administrator.

By implementing this strategy, you can ensure that your product catalog is complete and accurate, which will improve the user experience and help prevent issues like the ones you encountered with the `assiette-sidibou` slug.
